- Created 03/11/2021 (Recently, as you can see. If you see this profile and you know how to use GITHUB, contact me!)
- Bio: I'm Newbie Pythonista, Native Chilean (I can barely write this bio in English [Special thanks to |Google Traductor| ]), 
I have little knowledge in control with "if-else-and-or-is-in-False-True", while loops (mainly), for loops and data structures.
My objective of learning Python 3 is to specialize on Databases with Python and mySQL. (***But my main objective is to 
delve into the electrical, electronic and control aspects. I may learn C / C ++ from Electronics, but so far I don't know anything. 
I will try to update this profile when I have some time.***)
